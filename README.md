# GitHub Copilot Use-Case Showcase

## Developer Persona

### Scenario

I am an Intermediate Software Engineer joining a new team.

My team lead has assigned me the task of building a new backend microservice that should aggregate crypto prices from different exchanges so that we can report select cross-exchange crypto prices on our landing screen.

### Pick up an existing project

```
@workspace how do I launch this microservice using npm?
```

Follow the recommendation to add a `start` script.
